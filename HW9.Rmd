## 1
```{r}
Data <- lung
km_result <- survfit(Surv(time, status)~sex, data = Data, type = 'kaplan-meier')
plot(km_result,lty = c(1,2))
legend("topright", c("Male", "Female"), lty = c(1,2))
```

```{r}
fh_result <- survfit(Surv(time, status)~sex, data = Data, type = 'fleming-harrington')
plot(fh_result,lty = c(1,2))
legend("topright", c("Male", "Female"), lty = c(1,2))
```


### 2
```{r}
km_result
fh_result
```
\
From the result shown above we can find out that both of these two method have the same result. For male we get the median is 270, for female we get the median is 426.

## 3
```{r}
log_result <- survdiff(Surv(time, status)~sex, data = Data, rho=0)
log_result
```
